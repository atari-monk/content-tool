## Implementation Strategy

This sequential prompt set ensures:

1. **Foundation First**: Start with project structure and core framework
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Build from basic utilities to advanced features
3. **Consistency Maintenance**: Each prompt builds upon previous implementations
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management from the beginning
5. **Testing Integration**: Early testing infrastructure setup
6. **Cross-Platform Support**: Platform compatibility considered throughout

Each prompt is designed to be executed in sequence, with later prompts depending on the successful implementation of earlier components. The structure follows the Phase 2 deliverables outlined in the project plan while adhering to the architecture document specifications.
